You'll need to enable at least one of the [communications interfaces](#communications-interfaces) in the CMake configuration to use the examples.

The examples take two parameters for the device connection:
* For a serial connection: Port and baudrate. Port must start with `/dev/` on Linux or `COM` on Windows.
* For a TCP connection: Hostname and port. Hostname can be either a hostname like `localhost` or an IPv4 address.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for all released versions can be found [here](https://lord-microstrain.github.io/mip_sdk_documentation).

### C and C++ APIs

The C++ API is implemented on top of the C API to provide additional features:
* Object-oriented interfaces
* Improved type safety and sanity checking
* Better clarity / reduced verbosity (e.g. with `using namespace mip`)

The C++ API uses `TitleCase` for types and `camelCase` for functions and variables, while the C api uses `snake_case` naming for
everything. This makes it easy to tell which is being used when looking at the examples.

The C API can be accessed directly from C++ via the `mip::C` namespace.

### Command Results

MIP devices return an ack/nack field in response to commands to allow the user to determine if the command was
successfully executed. These fields contain a "reply code" which is defined by the MIP protocol. This library
additionally defines several "status codes" for situations where an ack/nack field is not applicable (i.e. if
the device doesn't respond to the command, if the command couldn't be transmitted, etc).

See the documentation page for [Command Results](https://lord-microstrain.github.io/mip_sdk_documentation/latest/command_results.html) for details.

### Timestamps

In order to implement command timeouts and provide time of arrival information, this library requires applications to
provide the time of received data. The time must be provided as an unsigned integral value with a reasonable precision,
typically milliseconds since program startup. By default the timestamp type is set to `uint64_t`, but some embedded
applications may wish to change this to `uint32_t` via the `MICROSTRAIN_TIMESTAMP_TYPE` define. Note that wraparound is
permissible if the wraparound period is longer than twice the longest timeout used by the application.

See the documentation page for [Timestamps](https://lord-microstrain.github.io/mip_sdk_documentation/latest/timestamps.html).


Communications Interfaces
-------------------------

Two connection types are provided with the MIP SDK to make it easy to run the examples on both Windows and Linux systems.

### Serial Port

A basic serial port interface is provided in C and C++ for Linux, Mac, and Windows. These can be modified for other platforms by the user.
The serial port connection will be used in most cases, when the MIP device is connected
via a serial or USB cable (the USB connection acts like a virtual serial port).

[Enable it](#build-configuration) in the CMake configuration with `-DMICROSTRAIN_ENABLE_SERIAL=1`.

### TCP Client

The TCP client connection allows you to connect to a MIP device remotely. The MIP device must be connected
via the normal serial or USB cable to a computer system running a TCP server which forwards data between
the serial port and TCP clients.

[Enable it](#build-configuration) in the CMake configuration with `-DMICROSTRAIN_ENABLE_TCP=1`.


How to Build
------------

### Prerequisites

* A working C compiler
  * C11 or later required
  * Define `MICROSTRAIN_ENABLE_CPP=OFF` if you don't want to use any C++. Note that some features are only available in C++.
* A working C++ compiler, if using any C++ features
  * C++14 or later is required.
  * C++20 or later for metadata and associated examples
* CMake version 3.10 or later (technically this is optional, see below)
* Doxygen, if building documentation

### CMake Build Configuration

The following options may be specified when configuring the build with CMake (e.g. `cmake .. -DOPTION=VALUE`):

| CMake Option                          | Default                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| MICROSTRAIN_ENABLE_LOGGING            | ON                         | Builds logging functionality into the library. The user is responsible for configuring a logging callback.                                                                                                                                                  |
| MICROSTRAIN_LOGGING_MAX_LEVEL         | MICROSTRAIN_LOG_LEVEL_WARN | Max log level the SDK is allowed to log.

### Compilation 

1. Create the build directory (e.g. `mkdir build`).
2. In the build directory, run `cmake .. <options>`
   * Replace `<options>` with your configuration options, such as `-DMICROSTRAIN_ENABLE_SERIAL=1`.
   * You can use `cmake-gui ..` instead if you'd prefer to use the GUI tool (and have it installed).
   * An alternative generator may be used, such as ninja, code blocks, etc. by specifying `-G <generator>`
3. Invoke `cmake --build .` in the build directory
4. (Optional, if MICROSTRAIN_BUILD_PACKAGE was enabled) Run `cmake --build . --target package` to build the packages.

### Building without CMake

If your target platform doesn't support CMake, you can build the project without it. To do so,
include all the necessary files and define a few options.

#### Minimum Required Files for building without CMake
##### C only
* All source files in `src/c/microstrain/common`, except logging.c if logging is disabled
* Source files in `src/c/microstrain/connections` for your required connection types
* All source files in `src/c/mip` and `src/c/mip/utils`
* All source files in `src/c/mip/definitions` (or at least all the required descriptor sets)
##### C++
* The C files indicated above, except those in `definitions` (they can be added too but aren't required)
* Source files in `src/cpp/microstrain/connections` for your required connection types
* All source files in `src/cpp/microstrain`
* All source files in `src/cpp/mip/definitions` (or at least the required descriptor sets)
* Source files in `src/cpp/mip/extras` as needed for your project
* Source files in `src/cpp/mip/metadata` if using metadata

#### Required #defines for building without CMake

Pass these to your compiler as appropriate, e.g. `arm-none-eabi-gcc -DMICROSTRAIN_TIMESTAMP_TYPE=uint32_t -DMICROSTRAIN_ENABLE_LOGGING=0`

These defines must be set when building the MIP SDK sources and for any code that includes
MIP SDK headers.

| MICROSTRAIN_ENABLE_LOGGING    | Enables logging facilities (e.g. via printf).                                        |
| MICROSTRAIN_LOGGING_MAX_LEVEL | Disables logging more detailed messages (e.g. debug tracing) to improve performance. |
| MICROSTRAIN_TIMESTAMP_TYPE    | Type to use for mip::Timestamp / mip::Timeout. Defaults to uint64_t if not defined.  |
| MICROSTRAIN_USE_STD_ENDIAN    | Define to 1 to enable the use of std::span from C++20.                               |
| MICROSTRAIN_USE_STD_SPAN      | Define to 1 to enable the use of std::endian from C++20.                             |
| MIP_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS        | Enables diagnostic counters.                                                         |

These options affect the compiled code interface and sizes of various structs. They
MUST be consistent between compiling the MIP SDK and any other code which includes
headers from the MIP SDK. (If you change them after building, make sure everything gets
rebuilt properly. Normally CMake takes care of this for you).

Known Issues
------------

* `suppress_ack=true` is not supported.
* The commanded BIT, device settings, and capture gyro bias commands can time out unless the timeout is increased.
